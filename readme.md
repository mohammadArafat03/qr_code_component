## My Processes

### Built With The Following

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Sass CSS extension
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first Workflow
- [https://cssgenerator.org/](https://cssgenerator.org/) - For getting the box shadow 'cause FRIK!

### What I learned

This is a very good way to start any frontend journey. The component was not very hard to build and you have to have a good foundation of HTML and CSS to finish this. While building this, I learned how to create and use Sass variables and and got a better understanding of flexbox and containers. Overall, it was a pretty good beginners challenge and I enjoyed making the QR Code component. This is also a way to get the hang of writing markdown documents which is also cool.

***html snippet***
```html
<div> // Main container centering the child containers with flexbox
    <div></div> // Child containers with child elements centered accordingly with flexbox
    <div></div> // """
    <div></div> // """
</div>
```

***sass variable snippet***
```sass
$variale_name: property;

```

### Continued Development

By finishing this project the following will be in effect:
- Making more robust HTLM5 pages by following BEM (Box Element Model).
- Properly understanding more about Mobile-first approach in temrs of CSS and responsiveness.
- Continue using Sass and learning more of the utilities and benefits provided by Sass.
- Discovery of more tools like [https://cssgenerator.org/](https://cssgenerator.org/) to make life a lot easier in some aspects of workflow.
